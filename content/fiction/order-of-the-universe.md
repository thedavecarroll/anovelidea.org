> This is an article which appeared in the Helmsman, a journalistic publication at the campus of the University of Memphis.

To the Editor:

I wish to comment on the opinion of any omnipotent being, such as God. In reading several articles about the topic
recently printed in the Helmsman, I could hardly believe what had been written; religious slanders and intellectual
cut-downs all giving their offense or defense of the divine.

First of all, a God does exist. Despite coincidences that might have led the human race to the point of development
which it currently holds, the probability of all of them happening in the same way without guidance is astronomically
astounding. So therefore, God exists. However, God may not exist as most perceive Him.

God can be assumed to exist as a universal, thus placing Him above any physical description. Most things without such
are ideas that exist within the near-infinite realms of human thought: the idea for numbers (although we see them, they
are only symbols which represent actual numbers), manhood (again, many might say manhood can be seen in others, but not
singularly as itself), or categories (which contain physical qualities in order to organize but not having any qualities
of their own). Given the above, God would most likely exist as a category, all that which is good (good for who, good
for what reason, or just simply good, is unknown) and primordial would belong to that category.

To obtain a better understanding of God, as much as our imperfections will allow, we need to grasp a basic idea, which
is likewise under continual attack. Time is the essential key to understanding God, for as existing as a universal He
would most definitely be above time. Not being subject to time can explain all the "prophecies" contained in the Holy
Bible. God would be able to observe mankind at any point of its existence, and thus "predict" with accurate infallibility.

Time, however, is difficult to explain as we are subject to it and must adhere to all aspects of it. But, nonetheless,
here is my rendition of the key at its simplest level. Time, from the beginning to the end, coexists within the same
confines of God's domain, the multiverse. I illustrate this fact by introducing the concept of 'tachyons', energy
particles that travel no slower than the speed of light. Theorists believe that these particles are the resultant energy
which accrues from the destruction of our universe. With speed such as theirs, they are believed to be traveling through
time to the beginning. Thus, time cannot truly be perceived unless one can comprehend infinity, and that is not possible
with any being that is not above infinity itself (for we can only comprehend that which is below us).

This will implant a higher desire to know more about God as described thus far in this response. God, quite simply,
could be the thoughts of all mankind throughout history (reference to time used for us, not Him). This would mean that
God is the "super-conscience" somewhat similar to the one introduced in the area of psychology near the beginning of
this century.

Time and the idea of a "super-conscience", as defined herein, would also offer an explanation for premonitions, deja vu,
and several more ESP occurrences.

Fundamentally, any definition of God from anyone or anything below infinity can never be accurate, only
self-satisfactory at the most.
