summary: "Do you believe in love at _First Sight_? (Spring 2003)"
---

No matter how many times\
You glimpse another,\
Or how many times you pass them by,\
Nothing can prepare you for\
The first time you meet, eye to eye.

Gazing through this flesh of mine,\
Seeing deep into your loving eyes,\
I realize that, what I now behold,\
Has been written of in times of old.

Bards, minstrels, and poets alike,\
Seem to have foreseen our first sight –\
For they describe it in intimate detail,\
Gazing into a soul, knowing love will avail.

When I look into your eyes,\
I see a future so bright –\
Visions of what could and might be,\
Hoping they come true

For both you and me.
