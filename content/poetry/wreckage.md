summary: "Is your life a _Wreckage_? (2008)"
---

I look around,\
I see the wreckage.\
Broken pieces scattered about.\
Shocked and shaken,\
I stand bewildered.

What can I do?\
How can I be of help?

A voice calls out,\
Amidst pain and suffering.\
Familiar to my ear,\
Yet different.\
I know this voice.

Who belongs to it?\
Why does he suffer?

Around again, I look.\
Bewilderment fades.\
I know what happened -\
The cause of this wreckage.\
The wrong path taken.

Whose voice did I hear?\
Whose pain did I feel?

And then, it was clear.\
The voice was once was my own -\
But a lifetime ago.\
Surrounded by broken dreams,\
I stand alone.

When did it go wrong?\
How did I lose control?

Anxiety swells my chest;\
Fear grips my mind.\
My life is devastated.\
Sadness burdens my heart,\
And the moment stretches on.

How long was I there?\
How long did I despair?

Then peace falls on my heart.\
A smile crawls over my face.\
The damage I saw was great,\
But I realize - I live.

I survived the wreckage of my life.
