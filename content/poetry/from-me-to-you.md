summary: "Compassion flows in _From Me to You_. (Spring 2003)"
---

From me to you,\
Ethereal whispers of lace –\
Symbols of our feelings,\
Reaching out with great haste.

From me to you,\
The memories flow –\
Artifacts of our time past,\
Invading the now, ‘til we must go.

From me to you,\
A tender touch –\
Hands of soft supple flesh,\
Caressing gently, saying so much.

From me to you,\
The transfer of dreams –\
Hearts aflutter with anticipation,\
Longing for fulfillment as they gleam.

From me to you,\
A glance exchanged –\
Eyes like beacons of our souls,\
Shining upon each other forever changed.

From me to you,\
This poem I write –\
Words of feeling and compassion,

Hoping you, like I, feel right.
