summary: "A man travels on a _Journey Home_ to lay his mother to rest. (Spring '93)"
---

It's been two years since I've seen the familiar countryside\
of my mother's hometown she left when she was five.\
Twenty years later, she moved back to the rural community,\
and stayed there for the rest of her life.

Down Leweir Street, we led the Cadillac convoy –\
the procession was on its way to my mother's funeral.\
I ache like a river bed.

Many put down her talent,\
as she had no high school diploma, at the age of fifty.\
She endured their assault, but they did not sway her;\
it merely kindled the flame which blazed like nomadic fires.\
Faded Roses and “Sweet By and By” are all we have\
to share her love and compassion.

The book was a window into her life,\
with life pushed to its limit.\
Her survival was dismal, at best,\
until she was laid in the ground.

The poem unlocked her heart,\
and released it to her own mother's passing.\
I was simple in form – complex in feeling,\
all the years of hate, all the years of love.

Growing up in that small town\
where the tracks cut the earth,\
She broke her back, doing this\
and doing that, to finish her chores\
And her sisters'.

My mother loved her own, but her stepfather\
looked at her with disgust. A bastard child,\
She must do more that her share to even try\
to win his love. But his hate was too strong,\
And she gave up.

In the small town of hypocrites, they\
looked to her, but offered no help.\
They made it harder for her to live,\
day by day, and talked behind her back.

She died, years after her husband, living in\
the small apartment. It cramped her,\
almost as much as the arthritis did. But she\
could afford, her home.\
Forgetfulness settled in her conscience,\
and the woman degenerated, from\
fusing spine and her weak heart to\
the pain in it for her second con. She gave up\
on him years ago; he won't be at the funeral.\
He gave up and she followed.

December rains on the plain casket\
as the minister delivered his final word.\
The mourners began to scatter and I saw them for who they are;\
vain relics of a time gone past wearing golf shirts\
with hairless white legs, varicose veins,\
Red Pendleton shirts stretched across rolls of fat\
shine as their pale skin shines through the fabric.

Like a blasted tree stump, my world is torn apart,\
The wind carries me away to that small town,\
where on my journey, I buried my mother.
