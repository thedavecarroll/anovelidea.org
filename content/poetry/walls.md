**A Dialogue of Id and Ego**

WHAT ARE THESE? Walls. \
DO THEY PROTECT OR HINDER? Both.\
EXPLAIN. These are the walls that I must build.\
WHY? So I can't be hurt.\
WHO HURTS YOU? Those.\
WHO ARE THEY? They are the ones who talk about me.\
WHY DO THEY TALK ABOUT YOU? I'm different.\
HOW? I'm smarter.\
HOW DO THESE WALLS HINDER YOU? I can't feel.\
WHAT CAN'T YOU FEEL? Emotions.\
DO YOU WANT TO FEEL? Yes.\
DESTROY THE WALLS. And let them hurt me?\
TAKE THE CHANCE. If I must.\
YOU DO. So I can live?\
YES. So I won't just merely exist?\
YES.\
TAKE THE CHANCE.
