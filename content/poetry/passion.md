summary: "What _Passion_ burns in your soul? (2008)"
---

From deep within your heart or mind or soul,\
Grows the will to seek it out and pursue,\
Something aesthetic perhaps only to you,\
But without it, your life would not be whole.

Each person maintains his or her own goal,\
Unless, of course, they fail to see it through.\
Those that do not, to themselves be untrue,\
And fall apart themselves without console.

Around each corner, passion may await,\
So be ever watchful and take the time\
To feel the stirrings deep within yourself.

A life without passion, you ought to hate\
Lest a pallid and drab life be your crime.

Your passion shall find and sustain itself.
