summary: "Have you thought what _The Kiss_ would feel like? (Spring 2003)"
---

Under a wave of blue sea,\
Moments of truth exposes my pain\
Then a touch so electrifying.

Fingers following the curve of my face;\
Our pulse quickens with anticipation.\
A hungry glance into my soul\
And I, wanting to know.

Two hearts seeking another,\
Our lips finding the other's.\
A hint of grape – the taste of hope,\
On your lips and now mine.

Insatiable our hunger,\
For yet another.\
Soon, there were three,

And we parted much closer.
