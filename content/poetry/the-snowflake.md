summary: "My first stint at poetry, _The Snowflake_, is an interpretation of a lost soul. (Spring '87)"
---

It falls among its ilk \
With a feel of softened silk. \
It flies like dandelions on a breezy coast, \
Chaos surrounding its humble host. \
Among the others, its identity is lost. \
It drifts helplessly, an icy frost, \
And melts under the sun. \
It is lost forever, forever gone.
