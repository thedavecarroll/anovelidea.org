summary: "Sin is on the menu in _The Feast_, but can you afford the tip? (Spring '94)"
---

We feast on Sin.

Some appetites are large,\
While others are small.\
There are gluttons,\
And those that eat like birds.\
We even have bulimics\
That force themselves to repent.\
But we hunger for more.

We must fast to be saved;\
Weakness will come from fasting.\
By becoming weak,\
We will be strengthened by the Lord.
