This site contains some of my thoughts, fiction, poetry, and character development.

**A Novel Idea** started back in 2000 with just the name, and a desire to write a novel.
Assuming the [Wayback Machine][1] is working, you can see a few [inceptions of this site][2] over the years.

In August of 2018, I started blogging on **PowerShell** at [Dave's Technical Journal][3].
If you're into Powershell, DevOps, Retro Computing, or general information technology, feel free to check it out.
