At various periods in my life, I've played role-playing games like Dungeons and Dragons.
The following are the two most recent characters that I've portrayed:

Quick-witted and quick-footed, [Miles Langley](/character-development/miles-langley/) was probably my favorite character I've played.
He's a bit of a rogue who's willing to bend the rules to ensure Good triumphs.
His history even includes the poetical song of bard that inspires courage in his fellow party members.

A few nights before his death, he has a late night rendezvous with a friend and has a nice [Interlude](/character-development/interlude/).

Let's look at the pre-history of [Barudok Kastokov](/character-development/barudok-kastakov/), defender of justice.
I portrayed Baru after Miles was killed, ironically by the creature Rashel warned against.
