Thus begins the story of Miles Langley, or at least the young man that is called such.

I found him 17 years ago, abandoned on the steps of the college with little indication of who he was or where he came
from. His basket and blanket were woven with a craft not common to this area. I could tell that he and his effects had
been on a long journey over miles of this land. That's why I named him Miles (for his traveling far) Langley (after my
own name). I had always wanted a son, but most ladies would tend toward the more manly professions. You see I am a
scribe and scholar at Torran's College. Apparently, these are professions that many, if not all, ladies could resist.

We offer thousands of books and tomes for anyone to study. Of course, unless you're a member, there is a price. Since
the college is rather orderly, I had to persuade my supervisor to allow Miles to stay at the college with me. He argued
that a babe without knowledge of his parents and their direction would disrupt our quiet college. He only agreed when I
staked my reputation and career on the line.

From as early as I can remember, Miles verbal skills and coordination seemed to develop faster than other infants that I
have read about. Also, I was worried about his frailty in the beginning, but in his teens, his body became tougher and
wiry. By his third year at the college, he was reading several languages. In his childhood, he was a voracious reader.
He soon began writing poetry, retelling tales of old about great quests. I guess that was when he started sensing that
he didn't really belong imprisoned, so to speak, in a college. He began snooping around, trying to overhear stories of
the college's patrons. He was even caught in the rafters, hiding, as if waiting to hear the greatest thing ever told.

One day, a strange and rather loud fellow came in the college to do research on ancient Thyatia. During his weeklong
stay, he talked with Miles several hours. He also played his lute and sang songs of great adventure. This was all that
Miles needed to make the decision to leave the college, but he could not stand leaving the only father he ever knew. The
next best thing was to study the world on paper, so he read maps and histories to quell his hunger for adventure.

The greatest adventure he found was when he had the chance to play with others around his age. It would frequently end
in a fight. Being smarter than most, Miles always seemed to have the attitude that he could do more or be more than
everyone else. His mouth usually said more than his body could back up. Surprisingly, he didn't get hurt too often. He
was usually able to out think or just plan out move any that he irritated.

The last few years in the college proved to be very trying for Miles, and for me. His antics have gotten me into trouble
many times with my supervisor. I was told that if Miles didn't settle down and become more productive, he would have to
go. I taught him the basics of scribing, but I could tell that his heart wasn't in it, even if his mind was.

And so, I have nurtured him and given him the skills that I could teach. To learn more, he will have to venture out into
the great world.

* * *

Langley died almost a year and a half ago of a heart attack. Miles took his death very hard and did nothing for a few
months. He stayed depressed until the same traveler that inspired him in his teens returned. Miles new that eventually
he would be leaving the college, either on his own or by order, so he asked the traveler to teach him things necessary
to survive a life of adventuring. Among other things, the traveler taught him about magic, how to channel his inner
power for various effects and how to wield items imbued with magic.

Miles had ventured into the city Sokolov many times as a young adult but, until he gained a sense of courage after
learning a little of magic, he never went to some of the forbidden places. After his 18 birthday had passed, Miles was
determined to learn a few things that would help him on his mission: adventure. He persuaded (a little with charm, but
more with gold) a guard to train him. Being quick footed he picked the rapier, which could use his nimbleness to his
advantage.

Late one night, a burglar entering the college abruptly awakened Miles. With his new skill, he subdued the thief but
realized that he could learn from him. A trade of life for teaching was agreed to and the thief told Miles all that he
knew about picking locks. So scared was the thief, he even volunteered his tools to Miles.
Physical

Miles is thin (130lbs) and wiry for his height (5'9”) with almost shoulder-length, sandy blonde hair and blue eyes. He
is very talkative, often going on about heroes and their great adventures. The last few years have distracted Miles from
his poetry and he's very self-conscious about reciting his poetry in front of large audiences.

## Inspire Courage (Words of Inspiration)

Fortes fortuna adiuvat,\
Fortune favors the bold.\
I sing of five wandering souls –\
Their deeds must be told.

There's Nyreece the arcanist,\
Xian the forest son,\
Nira fights for nature,\
Strong Vesta an Attican.

Last but not least is he who sings\
Yours truly, I am Miles.\
Now hear me sing about these five,\
And their courageous trials.

Nyreece the ordered mage\
Reads her tomes of lore.\
She stood alone against nature's rage,\
And magic raised the score.

Xian is a woodsman,\
He can track through muck or mire.\
Give care and treat him fair,\
Or be flamed on a pyre.

Nira is an oaken child,\
She listens to trees and beasts.\
Dark enemies of the wild,\
She cuts and burns with ease.

Vesta's strength is in her arms,\
Her sword and her shield.\
You can hear her thunderous charms,\
When she storms on the battlefield.

Miles is a scholar studying the world.\
Quick of wit and nimble foot,\
He springs into battle.\
Whip, whish, the rapier's song\
Singing his foe's requiem.

And though my song is done,\
Their great deeds have just begun.\
Fortune favors the bold, they say\
Fortes fortuna adiuvat.
